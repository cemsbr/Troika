Troika
======

Troika is a comprehensive configuration recommendation system for MapReduce 2.0. You provide Troika with a YARN application, and give it some constraints, such as execution time or budget. Troika then determines application-, framework-, and hardware-specific configuration recommendations that allow you to minimize execution time while remaining within your budget, or minimize your expenditure while remaining within execution time goals.
